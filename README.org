* Set up a vpn server in rpi


set up router for dns

install ovpn on rpi

add users and export ovpn files for each user
* set up open-vpn

download open-vpn on mac and upload a user.ovpn

login with ssh using the server's ip (192.168.1.51)

=ssh pi@192.168.1.51--->pass:raspberry=

* install collaborative tmux with emacs

https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CollaborativeEditing

* install OSCGroups both on rpi and mac (UNIX)

Client Side

On your unix machine (in this case a Mac) create a folder and name it =OSCGroupsInstall=

inside this folder clone OSCGroups from here: https://github.com/RossBencina/oscgroups

In OSCGroupsInstall folder clone also oscpack from here: https://github.com/RossBencina/oscpack

Now go to oscgroups folder and run =make=

Server side

Do the same for the server side (Install OSCGroups on RPI)

Now try to communicate (sending msgs from server to client and the opposite)

* Sending osc from server to mac

/Jason's solution/

*First step*

Go to oscgroups folder on your mac and run the below command:

=./bin/OscGroupClient...=

then open emacs and SC and run =OscGroups.enable=

*Next step*

Connect to vpn from openvpn app

then login with =ssh= on rpi server

run =./bin/OscGroupClient...= on rpi and then open emacs-shared with SC

open various SC workspaces and run =OscGroups.enable= for each workspace

Have fun!!
