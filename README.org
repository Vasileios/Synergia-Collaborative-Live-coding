#+TITLE: Synergia: A Collaborative - networked live coding interface

Synergia is a project for collabotative live coding in GNU Emacs and SuperCollider

Synergia uses an SSH server located in Greece.


* Installation

*Prerequisites*

/SuperCollider/

Download SuperCollider from here: https://supercollider.github.io/download

* Accessing Synergia

First open terminal and Clone this repository into your computer

Then go to shell_scripts folder and run the 1_oscgroups_sclang.sh to run OSCGroups on your

*Next step* (Connext to server)

Connect to server from openvpn app and then do SSH (see [[Connect to server]])

then login with ssh to the server

To do this run the 2_after_vpn.sh

If you succesfully logi in to the server go to ~/startup directory and run the
below command:

#+begin_src
./process.sh
#+end_src


On server you can start live coding with other users in SuperCollider

Have fun!!

* Connect to server

To Connect to the server you need to download open-vpn

Then open openvpn application and upload a user.ovpn

For more information about open-vpn see here: https://openvpn.net/cloud-docs/user-imports-received-profile-into-connect-client/
